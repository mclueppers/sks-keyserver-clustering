	# Background: Traditional SKS keyserver is not having a machine-readable implementation of the stats page.
    # It's actually presenting /pks/lookup?op=stats instead. Hockeypuck on the other hand is having
    # it properly implemented. This is what the current SKS status page script is looking for first hand.
    # But then parsing the returned JSON is limited to the basics with peers for example excluded and two 
    # extra expected key `numKeys` and `server_contact`. The latter a covered in a patch available at
    # https://github.com/mclueppers/hockeypuck/tree/sks-compatability
    #
    # Proxy MR request to the HTML endpoint so SKS status page falls back to parsing it instead of JSON
